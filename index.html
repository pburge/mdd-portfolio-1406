						<h1>A little bit about me:</h1>
						<p>Hello, World! My name is Paul Burge, I'm 28 years old, and I'm currently a student at Full Sail University. I hail from Los Angelas, California although I was raised in Miami, Florida since I was about 5 years old. I enjoy learning new web languages and pushing myself to be a better developer almost every chance I get. My love for all things code started when I was around 12. I remember I was on IGN's website looking up a guide for some game I was obssessed with at the time. When I saw that there was a chat feature, I clicked it and asked questions to a few of the users. One of whom suggested I download mIRC. From there, I learned all about mSL, "mIRC Scripting Language," and soaked up as much information as I could. Thinking back, I'm not sure what attracted me to coding. I think it might've been brought on by The Matrix and how random bits of code would periodically show on a computer screen in the movie which I thought looked cool. From there, I dabbled in C++ and Python. Although at the time I didn't quite understand it, so I tried my hand at HTML. By the time I was in my late-teens, I was building small sites just to learn and see what I was capable of. After I graduated high school, I stopped coding to start working to gain a little independence. It wasn't until I was 25 when I picked up on web development again. Soon after, I found Full Sail University, and now I'm close to graduating. So without writing an autobiography, I think I'll just keep little "about me" short and finish off with one last sentence:<br><br> I love coding and I love web development, despite the headaches it comes with.</p>
